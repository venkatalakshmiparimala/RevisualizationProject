## **Understanding Road Safety Statistics**
:::

Road accidents remain a significant public health concern, impacting thousands of lives every year. By analyzing road accidents and safety statistics, we can identify trends, evaluate safety measures, and propose data-driven solutions to improve transportation systems. This project focuses on UK road accident and safety statistics, leveraging data from the governmentâ€™s comprehensive guidance.

### Key Insights:

**Global Comparisons**\
This project explores how the UK fares in terms of road safety compared to other nations, identifying areas of success and potential improvement.

**Demographic Breakdown**\
We analyze accident data across age groups, vehicle types, and geographical regions to understand the most vulnerable populations and high-risk areas.

**Visual Enhancements**\
Previous visualizations lacked interactivity and coherence. Our redesigned charts and maps aim to improve clarity, accessibility, and user engagement.

### Visualizations Include:

-   **Road Accident Trends (2023):** Interactive line graphs showcasing the annual trends in accidents, injuries, and fatalities over time.

-   **Impact of Light and Weather Conditions on Road Accidents using a heatmap**: The heatmap reveals that road accidents are most frequent under "Daylight" and "Fine without high winds" conditions, with notable variations across other light and weather scenarios.

-   **Distribution of Accident Severity:** The histogram highlights that "Mild" accidents occur most frequently, followed by "Significant" and "Life-Threatening" incidents, indicating a skew toward less severe outcomes.

-   **Accident Trends Across Time Bands:** The visualization shows that "Daytime" experiences the highest number of accidents, followed by "Morning Rush Hour" and "Evening Rush Hour," with significantly fewer incidents during nighttime hours.

-   **Impact of Weather on Road Accidents:** The bar plot highlights that the majority of road accidents occur under "Fine without high winds" conditions, with fewer incidents recorded in adverse weather like fog or snow.

-   **Impact of Road Surface Conditions on Accidents:** The visualization shows that most accidents occur on "Dry" surfaces, followed by "Wet or damp" conditions, while adverse surfaces like "Snow," "Mud," and "Flood" have significantly fewer incidents.

### Objective:

This project aims to utilize statistical data to foster discussions on road safety, evaluate the impact of past measures, and provide actionable insights for future improvements. By presenting this data visually, we hope to engage policymakers, researchers, and the public in creating safer roads for everyone.
